**Phase 1: Prototyping Social Media**      
In this phase we designed an social media app prototype for IOS users.       
For this application, we considered the features of posting post, creating groups, forums, publishing news and several other features. The  users can follow their friends and also communicate with them in groups or forums.    
- You can check out our designs in this [Figma Design File](https://www.figma.com/file/DISw8Sr7Vf29dIoqPsnOx4/Software-Engingeering?node-id=0%3A1&t=VKr1hUstaSruKEIT-1).
- You can download our prototype's pages from this [link](https://github.com/amirezzati/SE/blob/main/Phase1%20%20-%20Prototyping%20Social%20Media/Pages.pdf).   
- Our phase 1 report is available in this [link](https://github.com/amirezzati/SE/blob/main/Phase1%20%20-%20Prototyping%20Social%20Media/SE%20-%20Phase%201%20report%20(2).pdf).

**Phase 2: Reviewing Some Social Media Projects**      
In this phase we checked [HumHub](https://github.com/humhub/humhub), [Oxwall](https://github.com/oxwall/oxwall), and [Dolphin](https://github.com/boonex/dolphin.pro) projects.     

We had three steps in this phase: 
- Checking all three projects to figure out which one meets our requirements to choose that for further steps. 
- Checking security of HumHub project with Acunetix and OWASP ZAP tools.
- Checking code equality of HumHub project with SonarQube tool.

Our phase 2 report is available in this [link](https://github.com/amirezzati/SE/blob/main/Phase2%20-%20Review%20Some%20Social%20Media%20Apps/SE%20-%20Phase%202%20report.pdf).

**Phase 3: Checking Performance, Load Testing, Stress Testing**      
In this phase we checked performance of [HumHub](https://github.com/humhub/humhub) project.     

We checked performance using these tools: 
- [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/) is a powerful tool that gives you the ability to analyse your PHP code and determine bottlenecks or generally see which parts of your code are slow and could use a speed boost.
- [KCacheGrind](https://kcachegrind.github.io/html/Home.html) is able to visualize output of other profilers like Xdebug.
- [Locust](https://locust.io/) is for load and stress testing.
- [JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) is for load and stress testing.

Our phase 3 report is available in this [link](https://github.com/amirezzati/SE/blob/main/Phase3%20-%20Checking%20Performance/SE%20-%20Phase%203%20report.pdf)
