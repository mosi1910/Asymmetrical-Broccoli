jQuery Time Entry
=================

Added the necessary bits to make this plugin compatible with a FE build toolchain based on Browserify.  
All credits go to [keith-wood](http://keith-wood.name/).  
Below the original readme from the Author.

This plugin sets an input field up to accept a time value using a spinner or the keyboard.

* Set time format, including seconds and/or 24 hour time.
* Integrates with mousewheel plugin.
* Expandable spinner for easier use.
* Over 20 localisations.

Have a look at the plugin Web site, http://keith-wood.name/timeEntry.html, for demonstrations of its abilities.
