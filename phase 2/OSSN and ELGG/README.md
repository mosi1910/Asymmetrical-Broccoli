Prerequisite
=============

https://www.opensource-socialnetwork.org/wiki/view/706/how-to-install-open-source-social-network

Directory Permissions
============
OSSN must be installed into a directory writable by the webserver, or it will not function properly. For most Linux servers running Apache v2, making the parent directory writable is very simple:

```
chgrp www-data /path/to/ossn_parent_directory
chmod g+w /path/to/ossn_parent_directory
``` 

If you are not running Apache v2 or are using a different type of webserver, you'll need to read your system's documentation or speak to your server administrator before proceeding.
