#Phase 2
in this phase we decided to test 3 tools for basic social media apps on our local server which was:
- Elgg
- Ossn
- Humhub
  <br>
You can read the Docs here: [link](https://github.com/mosi1910/Asymmetrical-Broccoli/blob/main/phase%202/Phase2.pdf)
  </br>
  </br>
  
after using these tools it seems obvious for us to use Humhub for our social media app we described the problems and goods every one of them had that you can read in the documents.
after that we ran some things on our server for testing it's security ( mentioned in first ReadMe ) that had some interesting outputs that is available in documents.
